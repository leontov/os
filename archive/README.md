# Archive

Legacy assets and generated artifacts that are kept for reference live here. The contents are not used by the active build or runtime code paths. Items include:

- `build-fuzz/`: historical fuzzing build output retained for comparison.
- `legacy_placeholders/`: placeholder files created by previous experiments.
- `logs/`: captured diagnostic traces preserved for triage and audit trails.

No automation reads from this directory; files can be pruned safely once no longer needed.
